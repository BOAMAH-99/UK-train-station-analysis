# UK Train Dashboard

This project explores and analyzes a UK train travel ticketing and travelling focusing on delays, cancellations, and refund request behaviour. The dashboard was built in **Power BI**, and insights were derived from a 31,000-row dataset

### Key Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard
- Visual analysis of delay trends, refund patterns, and revenue loss
- Testing to improve accuarecy of analysis

### Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy and Excel)
- Power BI (DAX, visuals, KPIs)
- Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings:
- Refunds are significantly higher for delayed and cancelled trips.
- There is a statistically significant relationship between reason for delay and likelihood of refund.
- Most refund requests come from moderately delayed trips, suggesting a threshold of customer patience.
- Refunds are not always correlated with high-priced tickets, showing behavioral trends beyond price sensitivity.
- Routes and ticket types showed varying refund rates, offering opportunities for targeted policy adjustments

  ### Strategic Recommendations:
