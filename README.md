# UK Train Station Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a UK train travel ticketing and travelling focusing on delays, cancellations, and refund request behaviour. The dashboard was built in **Power BI**, and insights were derived from a 31,000-row dataset

### Key Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard
- Visual analysis of delay trends, refund patterns, and revenue loss
- Testing to improve accuarecy of analysis

### Tools and Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy)
- Power BI (DAX, visuals, KPIs)
- Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Excel(Data set reading and comprehension)

### Key Findings:
- Refunds are significantly higher for delayed and cancelled trips as expected.
- Even with a small rate of delayed/cancelled trips, delayed trips (7.24%) and cancelled trips (6%) still cost a combined 172K, over 25% of monthly revenue. This highlights that the financial impact is high, suggesting high reveue trips and high-volume routes are the subjects of this inconveniences.
- Delayed trips are 3 times more costly than cancellations, this highlights the amount of money that could possibly be lost but not lost yet and need improvement.
- There is a statistically significant relationship between reason for delay and likelihood of refund, with technical issues and performance of staff being the main internally controllable issues.
- Most refund requests come from moderately delayed trips, suggesting a threshold of customer patience which should be targeted for delay reduction efforts
- Refunds are not always correlated with high priced tickets, showing behavioral trends beyond price sensitivity.
- Routes and ticket types showed varying refund rates, offering opportunities for targeted policy adjustments.
- Advance ticket holders book earlier but cancel more possibly due to shifting plans.
- Despite strong on time performance (87%), the high cost of delayed trips (127K) and refund requests suggest hidden inefficiencies
- Operational issues lead and held a significant share in the reasons for the delayed and called trips highlight the need for staff investment.
- The York to Peterborough, York to Durham, York to Doncaster, York to Edinburgh and Reading to Swindon routes had the domimant share of routes bringing in refund requests, 1,077, with York being a refund request hotspot for customers as a depature location.

  ### Strategic Recommendations:


  With a few enhancements to data granularity and a shift from reactive to predictive management, the train system can significantly boost both profitability and customer trust.
